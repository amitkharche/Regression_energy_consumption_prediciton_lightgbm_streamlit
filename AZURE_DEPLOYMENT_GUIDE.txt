# Azure Web App Docker Deployment Guide

1. Ensure you have `Dockerfile` in the root directory.
2. Push this project to GitHub.
3. Go to Azure Portal → Create Web App → Choose Docker → Point to GitHub Repo.
4. Choose build trigger (on push to main).
5. Select port `8501` and deploy.

No extra YAML needed. Azure uses your Dockerfile directly.
